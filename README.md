#### Software Engineering student
As a student venturing into the world of coding, my skills are still a work in progress, but I'm enjoying every step of the journey. With the unwavering support of my loving family, I'm on a path of self-discovery within the software engineering domain. Right now, I'm coding purely for the fun of it.
I find immense pleasure in the art of coding, and I'm particularly fond of Neovim, which adds an extra layer of excitement to my coding adventures. As I continue to explore this dynamic field, I'm also in the process of discovering my specific niche. My main focus is on enjoying the coding process while making a positive impact on the world around me.
