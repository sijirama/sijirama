##### Software Engineer.

It might seem like I'm all over the place, building all sorts of applications, but I'm gradually working towards achieving my dream of someday working on technology and software that will actually help people and transform lives.

> It is not enough that you should understand about applied science in order that your work may increase man's blessings. Concern for man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors,
> concern for the great unsolved problems of the organization of labor and the distribution of goods in order that the creations of our mind shall be a blessing and not a curse to mankind. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations.
